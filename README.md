# TV-Net

This paper propose a new approach that features an enhanced tensor voting module and a customized pixel-level pavement crack segmentation network structure, called TV-Net. By optimizing the tensor voting framework and exploring the relationship between tensor scale factor and crack distribution, the tensor voting fusion module is introduced to enhance the feature mapping by combining the important domain mapping generated by tensor voting. In addition, the proposed structural consistency loss function is combined to improve the segmentation accuracy and ensure the consistency with the structural features of cracks obtained by tensor voting. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
